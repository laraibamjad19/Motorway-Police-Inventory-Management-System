# Motorway-Police-Inventory-Management-System

The purpose of our product system is to assist National Highway and Motorway Police  (NHMP) in managing its inventory items such as uniform, cap, gadgets, arms etc. Moreover, it will also help keep track of the issuance of these items to trainees as well as other employees. Inventory optimization will be incorporated in our system which will help in maintaining just the right amount of inventory for each product, without over- or under-stocking any item. It will also enhance product visibility and traceability in the event of a recall. With continuous fluctuations in stock levels, the risk of human error will be greatly reduced through automation in the system.
